    "analysis": " 1. Environmental Impact Analysis:\n   The provided data shows the composition of waste generated from various sources. The main categories are plastic, paper, glass, organic waste, and metal.\n\n   - Plastic waste is a significant concern due to its non-biodegradable nature, which leads to pollution in land and water bodies.\n   - Organic waste, if not managed properly, can lead to methane emissions when decomposing in landfills, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.\n   - The amount of paper waste might seem high, but it can be more environmentally friendly if it's recycled appropriately.\n   - Glass and metal waste, while not as concerning in terms of pollution, should still be properly managed to conserve resources and reduce waste.\n\n2. Proper Disposal Recommendations:\n   - Plastic waste: Reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as possible. Proper disposal includes sending plastics to recycling centers if they are labeled as recyclable.\n   - Organic waste: Compost organic waste at home if possible, or send it to a commercial composting facility. Avoid sending organic waste to landfill if possible.\n   - Paper waste: Recycle paper products whenever possible. Do not send infectious or contaminated paper to recycling centers; these should be disposed of as medical waste.\n   - Glass and metal waste: These can be recycled at designated recycling centers.\n\n3. Safety Precautions:\n   - Always wear protective gloves and masks when handling waste, especially infectious or hazardous materials.\n   - Do not touch waste with bare hands.\n   - Avoid inhaling dust or fumes from waste materials.\n   - Follow local regulations and guidelines for waste disposal and handling.\n\n4. Recycling Guidelines:\n   - Check local recycling guidelines for specific materials accepted in your area.\n   - Properly clean and sort recyclable materials before putting them in recycling bins.\n   - Some materials, such as batteries and electronics, should never be placed in regular recycling bins due to hazardous materials; these should be properly disposed of at designated facilities.\n   - Keep recyclables dry and free of food waste.\n   - Paper, cardboard, metal cans, and glass should be rinsed clean and flattened before recycling.\n   - Plastic containers should be cleaned and dried, but do not put them in recycling if they have the numbers 3, 6, or 7 on the bottom as they are often not recyclable. The numbers 1 and 2 are more commonly recyclable.",
