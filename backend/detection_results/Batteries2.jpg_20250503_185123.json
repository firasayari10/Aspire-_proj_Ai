    "analysis": " 1. Environmental Impact Analysis:\n   Analyzing the provided waste management data, it can be observed that the majority of waste generated is organic waste (55%), followed by plastic waste (30%), glass (5%), paper (3%), and metal (2%). The high percentage of organic waste poses a potential environmental threat if not managed properly, as it can lead to methane production in landfills, a potent greenhouse gas. High levels of plastic waste can end up in oceans and water bodies, causing harm to marine life. The low percentage of recyclable materials like paper, glass, and metal means there is significant room for improvement in recycling efforts.\n\n2. Proper Disposal Recommendations:\n   - Organic waste: Composting is the recommended method for organic waste disposal. This method reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, decreases methane production, and produces nutrient-rich compost for gardening.\n   - Plastic waste: Proper segregation of plastic waste is essential. You should recycle plastics with the codes 1 (PETE, PET, PETE) and 2 (HDPE) as they are widely recycled. Other plastics such as 3 (PVC), 4 (LDPE), 5 (PP), 6 (PS), and 7 (Other) should be taken to designated recycling centers or special collection points.\n   - Glass: All glass types (green, brown, and clear) are recyclable and should be taken to designated recycling centers or special collection points.\n   - Paper and cardboard: These materials are widely recyclable. Ensure to remove any food or plastic maintenance before recycling.\n   - Metal: Aluminum cans, tin cans, and other metal items are generally recyclable. They can be sold to scrap metal dealers or taken to recycling centers.\n\n3. Safety Precautions:\n   - Always wear gloves when handling waste to protect against germs and sharp objects.\n   - Be aware of hazardous waste such as batteries, paint, solvents, and electronic waste. These materials should not be disposed of in regular waste bins but taken to special collection points or hazardous waste disposal facilities.\n   - Be mindful of large or heavy items that may cause injury during collection or transport.\n\n4. Recycling Guidelines:\n   - Rinse and clean all recyclable containers before placing them in the recycling bin to minimize contamination.\n   - Broken glass should be carefully wrapped in newspaper or a cardboard box before placing in the recycling bin.\n   - Recycle papers and cardboards in bundles to save space in the recycling bin and encourage efficient transportation.\n   - Separate plastic recyclables by type (based on the recycling codes) and ensure they are clean and dry before recycling.\n   - Participate in community recycling programs or find local recycling facilities to ensure your recyclables are properly processed.\n   - Compost organic waste at home or find community composting programs to reduce methane production in landfills and create nutrient-rich compost for gardening.",
