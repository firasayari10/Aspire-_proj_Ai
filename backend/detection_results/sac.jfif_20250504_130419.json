    "analysis": " Environmental Impact Analysis:\n\nBased on the provided waste detection results, we can identify several types of waste generated: plastic, glass, paper, metal, and hazardous waste.\n\n1. Plastic: Plastic waste, if not properly managed, can significantly contribute to environmental pollution, particularly marine pollution. Plastics take a long time to degrade and can harm wildlife through ingestion and entanglement.\n\n2. Glass: Glass waste, if not recycled, occupies landfill space, but it doesn't decompose easily. However, its impact on the environment is generally less compared to other types of waste due to its inert nature.\n\n3. Paper: Paper waste can lead to deforestation and related issues like habitat loss and carbon emissions if not managed properly.\n\n4. Metal: Metals, particularly hazardous metals like lead, mercury, and batteries, can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of correctly, posing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nHazardous Waste: improper disposal of hazardous waste can lead to soil and groundwater contamination, air pollution, and potential health risks for humans and wildlife.\n\nProper Disposal Recommendations:\n\n1. Plastic: Recycle plastic whenever possible. Properly dispose of non-recyclable plastics at designated waste disposal facilities.\n\n2. Glass: Recycle glass when possible. If not recyclable, dispose of it at a landfill.\n\n3. Paper: Recycle paper to reduce paper mill waste and deforestation. Compost organic paper waste like cardboard, newspapers, and old mail.\n\n4. Metal: Recycle metals whenever possible. For hazardous metals like batteries, lights, and electronics, follow local regulations for safe disposal.\n\nSafety Precautions:\n\n1. Always handle waste with gloves to avoid direct contact and potential contamination.\n2. Segregate waste properly to ensure it gets to the correct disposal facility.\n3. When handling hazardous waste, follow local regulations and safety guidelines, including the use of protective equipment.\n4. Do not burn waste as it releases harmful pollutants into the air.\n\nRecycling Guidelines:\n\n1. Check local recycling regulations as they may vary.\n2. Rinse food and drink containers to remove excess food waste before recycling.\n3. Flatten cardboard boxes for easier recycling.\n4. Keep electronics, batteries, and other hazardous waste out of the regular recycling stream.\n5. Reuse reusable items as much as possible before recycling.",
